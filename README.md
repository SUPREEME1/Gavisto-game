Gavisto - Mole Game
Gavisto is an interactive, story-based game where players take on the role of an undercover informant known as “Mole” attempting to infiltrate a dangerous cartel led by Gustavo. Players must make careful dialogue choices and answer questions to avoid raising suspicion while gathering intel on the cartel’s operations. Each question reveals more about the characters, including Gustavo, the cartel's ruthless leader, Carlos, the loyal enforcer, and Maria, the calculating advisor. Answer correctly to advance through the story, but be cautious—too many wrong answers, and Mole’s cover will be blown.

The game combines suspenseful narrative elements with decision-making to create a dynamic experience, testing the player’s wit and intuition in a high-stakes environment.
